## **3. Problem Statement**
In emergencies, people often struggle to quickly alert trusted contacts with accurate location details. Manual communication takes time, and in some cases, users may not be able to type or call. This delay can compromise safety, especially for students, women, travelers, and senior citizens.

---

## **4. Proposed Solution / Idea**
**GuardianTrack** is a mobile application designed to send instant emergency alerts to trusted contacts with the user’s live location. With a single tap, the app will share predefined messages through SMS or messaging apps.  

The initial version will be frontend-driven, focusing on a clean UI and basic functionality. Backend features like real-time location tracking and push notifications will be added in later stages as development skills progress.

## **5. Key Features**
- One-tap emergency alert button.  
- Send current location via SMS or WhatsApp.  
- Trusted contacts list.  
- Map integration to display the user’s position.  
- Simple, clean, and responsive UI.  
- *(Future)* Real-time tracking & push notifications.

## **6. Target Users / Audience**
- Students  
- Women commuters  
- Travelers & tourists  
- Senior citizens  
- Anyone wanting to share live safety updates with family/friends
